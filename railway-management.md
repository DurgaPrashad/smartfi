# üöÑ Railway Server Management Guide

## üìä **Understanding Your Server Status**

The log message `2025/07/26 13:58:19 starting server on port: 8080` indicates your **Railway Fi MCP server is running successfully**.

## üõë **How to Stop/Manage Railway Services**

### **Option 1: Railway CLI Commands**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link 6f4fe9db-e618-4b7f-babd-cdf99f7f17dd

# View service status
railway status

# Stop the service temporarily
railway service:pause

# Start the service again
railway service:resume

# View logs
railway logs

# Delete the deployment (CAREFUL!)
railway service:delete
```

### **Option 2: Railway Dashboard**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Login to your account
3. Find project: `6f4fe9db-e618-4b7f-babd-cdf99f7f17dd`
4. Click on your Fi MCP service
5. Use the **"Pause"** or **"Delete"** button

### **Option 3: Environment Management**
```bash
# Set service to sleep when inactive
railway variables set RAILWAY_SLEEP_APPLICATION=true

# Set auto-sleep timeout (in seconds)
railway variables set RAILWAY_SLEEP_TIMEOUT=3600
```

## üîß **Service Management Options**

### **Pause Service (Recommended)**
- **Purpose**: Temporarily stop without losing data
- **Effect**: Service stops, no charges, easy to resume
- **Command**: `railway service:pause`

### **Delete Service (Permanent)**
- **Purpose**: Completely remove the service
- **Effect**: All data lost, cannot be recovered
- **Command**: `railway service:delete`

### **Sleep Configuration**
- **Purpose**: Auto-pause when inactive
- **Effect**: Saves costs, auto-wakes on requests
- **Setup**: Set `RAILWAY_SLEEP_APPLICATION=true`

## üì± **Current Server Info**

- **URL**: `https://fi-mcp-dev-production.up.railway.app`
- **Port**: `8080` (internal Railway port)
- **Project ID**: `6f4fe9db-e618-4b7f-babd-cdf99f7f17dd`
- **Status**: Active and running ‚úÖ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

### **Before Stopping:**
- Your SmartFi app depends on this server for data
- Stopping it will break the Fi MCP demo functionality
- Make sure you want to interrupt the service

### **Cost Considerations:**
- Railway charges for active compute time
- Pausing saves money while preserving the deployment
- Sleep mode is a good middle ground

### **If You Want to Keep SmartFi Working:**
- **Don't stop** the Fi MCP server
- It provides the financial data for your app
- Consider sleep mode for cost optimization

## üéØ **Recommended Actions**

### **For Cost Optimization:**
```bash
# Enable auto-sleep after 1 hour of inactivity
railway variables set RAILWAY_SLEEP_APPLICATION=true
railway variables set RAILWAY_SLEEP_TIMEOUT=3600
```

### **For Complete Shutdown:**
```bash
# Pause the service (can be resumed later)
railway service:pause
```

### **For Permanent Removal:**
```bash
# Delete the service (CANNOT be undone)
railway service:delete
```

## üöÄ **Alternative: Keep It Running**

If you want to showcase your SmartFi app:
- **Keep the server running** for demos
- **Enable sleep mode** to reduce costs
- **Monitor usage** in Railway dashboard
- **Scale down** if needed for cost control

Your Fi MCP server is working perfectly and enabling your SmartFi application to provide real financial data! üéâ
